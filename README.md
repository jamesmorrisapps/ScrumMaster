# ScrumMaster
A simple Scrum Management Suite for project managers.

Users can add different projects, select if they are short-term or long-term, how many scrums are in each project, 
track their projects and scrums completed, and get notified when they are completed. Users can also delete projects if they
are done, or no longer important.
